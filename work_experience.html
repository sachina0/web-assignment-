            <p class="p">"Being a trek porter is a tough job that only a few will realise. While people who are accustomed to the job will find it easier, the newcomers might have a hard time fitting in.

                Besides, I have not been to many places. Going to Poon Hill twice is all I've got to share. I had a really great time there as the group was huge. We, 27 people, were walking in a straight line, much like a bunch of ants over the hills where the magnificent scenery of the mountains awaited us. It took us three whole days to reach the very top while it took three days for the descent. Moreover, our group members (or the guests) were much amicable than expected. As we were talking to them during the trek, the loads felt a little lighter. We sang and danced all along the way while interacting with the villagers, clicking photos as well as stopping to feed our hungry stomachs. And as it was my first time, the trek leader told me that I was lucky to have been with that group.
                
                In the gist of it, I really enjoyed..
                ...I really enjoyed my first trek, being blessed with very kind hearted souls on one the easiest hiking destinations, Poon Hill !</p>
